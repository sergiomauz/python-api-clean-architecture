- To run microservice with FastAPI: **``python -m debugpy --listen 0.0.0.0:5678 main_fastapi.py``**
- To run microservice with Flask: **``python -m debugpy --listen 0.0.0.0:5678 main_flask.py``**
- Install extensions for VS Code: "Mono Kai Pro", "Python Indent", "Python Envinronments", "Pylance", "Python", "Python Debugger" and "Dev Containers".
- Open VS Code with a remote connection to Docker, attaching container **"warehouse_inventory_api"**.
- After running microservice (FastAPI or Flask), to start debugging mode, in VS Code press **F5** and set breakpoints in the code.
- Go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) to verify that the microservice is running. You can use endpoints with the client of your preference.
